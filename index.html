    <p>
      Steak is my favourite food because it tastes amazing when cooked to
      perfection. But if its not cooked to perfection, its pretty bad. My
      favourite way to eat it is medium rare.

      Bluelock is my favourite anime because once again, its about soccer. This
      anime has lots more to it though, I love the constant build up and
      intensity it provides thruought the course of the anime.
